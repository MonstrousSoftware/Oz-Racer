# CanyonRacer

Game inspired by Wipeout and Star Wars pod racer.

A [libGDX](https://libgdx.com/) project generated with [gdx-liftoff](https://github.com/tommyettinger/gdx-liftoff).

This project was generated with a template including simple application launchers and a main class extending `Game` that sets the first screen.

## Platforms

- `core`: Main module with the application logic shared by all platforms.
- `lwjgl3`: Primary desktop platform using LWJGL3.
- `teavm`: Experimental web platform using TeaVM and WebGL.




12/03/2024:
- Last week a pull request was merged into LibGDX 1.12.2-SNAPSHOT to support anti-aliased frame buffers. This allows to use antialiasing in combination
 with post-processing shaders (e.g. vignette effect). This is only possible on desktop. The teavm version, uses FBO without AA.
